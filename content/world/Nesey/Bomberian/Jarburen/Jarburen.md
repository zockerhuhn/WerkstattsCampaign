## Map

```leaflet    
id: Nessey-Bomberian_Jarburen_Map  
### Lock pins so they can't be moved  
lock: false  
### If true, view of map will recenter as you zoom out.

noScrollZoom: false

### Map Pixel Height x 1 / (80 / 250)  
### Map Pixel Width x 1 / (80 / 250)  
### Note that this formula requires adjustments depending on your map. The idea is to determine the number of units between your bar scale. We divide by 100 here because my bar scale measures in 100 units. If your maps scale bar measures in units of 50 them you should divide by 50 instead. The idea is to calculate how many pixels are equal to 1 unit.  
### Bounds is entered as [Height, Width]  
bounds: [[0,0], [12.8063, 12.7906]]  
height: 900px  
width: 95%  
### This sets where the map starts by default. Set it to the middle (half) of your bounds.  
lat: 6.4031 
long: 6.3953
### 0 is no zoom. Negative zoom steps away from the map. Positive zoom steps towards the map.  
minZoom: -1.5  
### Max zoom is 18.  
maxZoom: 10.5  
### Hover mouse over the Reset Zoom icon to see your current zoom level.  
defaultZoom: 6  
### How far it zooms in or out with each step. Can be in decimals.  
zoomDelta: 0.5  
### This is a string so can be any text. Change it to match your maps measurement scale.  
unit: Kilometer 
scale: 1  
darkMode: false

## Locations
### Trade Town
*Trade Town is a pretty large district to the north of Jarburen housing almost every magic shop there is. No matter if it's spell components you searched for or shady wizards performing even shadier spells, you will find it here. In the heart of the district lies the [Adventurer's Guild](Jarburen#Adventurer's%20Guild), making it the perfect district for every adventurer. Even if you're not from the city it's easy to find a nice cozy room for the night above one of the many taverns.* 

##### Adventurer's Guild
*There are no active quests currently*

[DMQuests](DMJarburen#Quests)

## Black Shrine
*Black Shrine contains mostly the homes of the many citizens of Jarburen. Most times there is nothing going on here but you might catch one of the rare occasions, who knows...*
#### Forest Borough
claims to be an independant district but everyone knows it's just Black Shrine
