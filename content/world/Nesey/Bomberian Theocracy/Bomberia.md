## History
After the [[Jarburen#Vyas|Vyas Family]] founded Bomberia they were always open to their folk and even granted people the chance to speak to [[Nesey#Jarburenese Faith|Rench]]. After signing the peace treaty with [[Bindulag]] nothing really happend until 2 years ago when a new generation in the family took over. Since then no one has been able to speak to Rench and the family also barely does public appearances anymore. In recent times there have also been fewer and fewer visitors.
